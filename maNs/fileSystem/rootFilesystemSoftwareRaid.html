<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There are plenty of how-to guides that explain how to get a striped RAID-0
file system mounted as your root file system in Linux using an
initramfs.&nbsp; This web page explains a simpler and easier way that
requires no initramfs.</p>

<h2>How-To</h2>

<p>If you boot a kernel with RAID and the other necessary drivers built in
(NOT as modules), it will automatically assemble partitions of type fd
("Linux raid autodetect") into a RAID array that you can use as your root fs
without the need for an initramfs.&nbsp; As of kernel version 3.7.9, the
necessary options for RAID are under Device Drivers &rarr; Multiple devices
driver support (RAID and LVM) &rarr; RAID support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD):</p>

<table><tr>
<td>
<img src="menuconfig_RAID.png">
</td><td>
<ul>
<li>Autodetect RAID arrays during kernel boot (CONFIG_MD_AUTODETECT)</li>
<li>Linear (append) mode (CONFIG_MD_LINEAR)</li>
<li>RAID-0 (striping) mode (CONFIG_MD_RAID0)</li>
<li>[... other RAID modes ...]</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not the same as the RAID option under "Device mapper support."
</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Of course, you will also need to build in other essential drivers like
those for your hard drive and motherboard chipset.&nbsp; If that is too
difficult to figure out, try Slackware's huge.s prebuilt kernel.</p>

<p>You will also need a small, non-RAID partition that is just big enough to
hold the stuff that normally goes in /boot (the kernel, System.map, config,
and a few LILO files), because the kernel itself cannot be loaded from the
RAID array.</p>

<p>Following is what I did to get this working using a Slackware 14.0-based
installation CD.</p>

<p><ol>

<li>Replaced the Slackware kernel package with my own build of mainline
kernel 3.7.9 in which most things are built in.&nbsp; Only certain things
(like ALSA) really need to be modules.</li>

<li>At the root prompt after booting from the CD, partitioned the two hard
disks using fdisk.

  <ul>

  <li>Due to a <a
  href="http://serverfault.com/questions/265056/mdadm-assembles-with-drives-instead-of-partitions">special
  feature</a> of the superblock format that RAID autodetect requires, it is
  necessary to exclude the last 64&nbsp;kB (128&nbsp;sectors) of a device
  from the RAID partition.&nbsp; In this example, the size of sdb1 had to be
  reduced by 128 sectors from the default size that filled the disk.</li>

  <li>/dev/sda was larger than /dev/sdb, but I partitioned them so that the
  RAID-0 partitions would be exactly the same size.&nbsp; This required
  specifying the size of sda1 using the last sector number rather than an
  offset of so many KB.</li>

  </ul>

<pre>
Disk /dev/sda: 6488 MB, 6488294400 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 788 cylinders, total 12672450 sectors

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1            2048     8421711     4209832   fd  Linux raid autodetect
/dev/sda2         8423424     8525823       51200   83  Linux
/dev/sda3         8525824     8787967      131072   82  Linux swap
/dev/sda4   *     8787968    12672449     1942241    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
</pre>

<pre>
Disk /dev/sdb: 4311 MB, 4311982080 bytes
58 heads, 61 sectors/track, 2380 cylinders, total 8421840 sectors

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1            2048     8421711     4209832   fd  Linux raid autodetect
</pre>
</li>

<li>Still at the root prompt, created the RAID array, telling mdadm to
use the old 0.90 superblock format:
<pre>
mdadm -C /dev/md0 -l 0 -e 0.90 -n 2 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1
</pre>

<p>If the partitions are different sizes, one can choose linear RAID
(a.k.a. JBOD = Just a Bunch of Disks) instead of RAID-0 at this point by
saying &ndash;l linear instead of &ndash;l 0.&nbsp; (TO DO:&nbsp; Test
whether the separate boot partition is still necessary for linear RAID.)</p>

<p>If mdadm prints errors about disks already in use, you can get rid of
an existing autodetected array with mdadm &ndash;S /dev/md0 and then
proceed as above.</p>

<p>After creating the array but before going through the entire Slackware
setup, it's wise to reboot and see how (and if) the newly created array is
autodetected.&nbsp; Just because it works from the command line when you've
explicitly specified the devices doesn't mean that it will be autodetected
properly by the kernel.</p>

</li>

<li>Started Slackware setup.</li>

<li>Specified /dev/md0 as the root file system and formatted it.</li>

<li>Formatted /dev/sda2 and mounted it on /boot.</li>

<li>Ran through the remaining Slackware install process as usual, allowing it
to drop the kernel into /boot and choosing /dev/md0 as the root during LILO
installation.&nbsp; (One does not need to say anything about /dev/sda2 in
lilo.conf.)</li>

<li>Exit setup and reboot.&nbsp; It boots.&nbsp; Done!</li>

</ol></p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><ol>
<li>The RAID used here was Linux's own software RAID, which always works.&nbsp;
It did not involve the BIOS of a modern "fakeraid" motherboard or anything
else.</li>

<li>RAID-1 (mirrored not striped) does not necessitate a separate boot
partition.&nbsp; LILO can boot the kernel directly from any device in the
array.&nbsp; RAID-0 is a challenge because a kernel stored within the RAID
array would get split across the multiple devices, and LILO needs it in one
piece to boot it.</li>

<li>/dev/mdN is used for a non-partitionable array.&nbsp; A partitionable
array would use /dev/md_dN or /dev/md/dN instead.&nbsp; See the DEVICE NAMES
section at the bottom of the mdadm man page.</li>

<li>The kernel RAID autodetect feature has been called "deprecated" for a
long time, but if it suffices for the task, it's still the easiest way.</li>
</ol></p>
