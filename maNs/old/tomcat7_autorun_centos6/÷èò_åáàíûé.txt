[root@srv6 ~]# mkdir /usr/java    


Change to the /usr/java directory we created

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 ~]# cd /usr/java    
[root@srv6 java ]#   


Download the appropriate JDK and save it to /usr/java directory we created above.

Unpack jdk-7u5-linux-x64.tar.gz in the /usr/java directory using tar -xzf:

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 java]# tar -xzf jdk-7u5-linux-x64.tar.gz  


This will create the directory /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_05. This will be our JAVA_HOME.


We can now set JAVA_HOME and put Java into the path of our users.

To set it for your current session, you can issue the following from the CLI:
view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 java]# JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_05  
[root@srv6 java]# export JAVA_HOME  
[root@srv6 java]# PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH  
[root@srv6 java]# export PATH  

To set the JAVA_HOME permanently, however, we need to add below to the ~/.bash_profile of the user (in this case, root). 
We can also add it /etc/profile and then source it to give to all users.
view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_05  
export JAVA_HOME  
PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH  
export PATH  
Once you have added the above to ~/.bash_profile, you should log out, then log back in and check that the JAVA_HOME is set correctly.

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 ~]#  echo $JAVA_HOME  
/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_05  


Note: If you decided to use JDK 6 rather than 7 as we did above, simply save the JDK 6 bin file to /opt (or another location), then navigate to /usr/java and issue: 'sh /opt/jdk-6u33-linux-x64.bin'. This will create a JAVA Home of /usr/java/jdk1.6.0.33 


Step 2: Download and Unpack Tomcat 7.0.29 (or latest)



We will install Tomcat 7 under /usr/share.

Switch to the /usr/share directory:

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 ~]# cd /usr/share  
[root@srv6 share ]#   
Download apache-tomcat-7.0.29.tar.gz (or the latest version) here

and save it to /usr/share

Once downloaded, you should verify the MD5 Checksum for your Tomcat download using the md5sum command.

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 share ]# md5sum apache-tomcat-7.0.29.tar.gz  
307076fa3827e19fa9b03f3ef7cf1f3f *apache-tomcat-7.0.29.tar.gz  
Compare the output above to the MD5 Checksum provided next to the download link and you used above and check that it matches. 

unpack the file using tar -xzf:

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 share ]# tar -xzf apache-tomcat-7.0.29.tar.gz    
This will create the directory /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29


Step 3: Configure Tomcat to Run as a Service.



We will now see how to run Tomcat as a service and create a simple Start/Stop/Restart script, as well as to start Tomcat at boot.

Change to the /etc/init.d directory and create a script called 'tomcat' as shown below.

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 share]# cd /etc/init.d  
[root@srv6 init.d]# vi tomcat  
And here is the script we will use.

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
#!/bin/bash  
# description: Tomcat Start Stop Restart  
# processname: tomcat  
# chkconfig: 234 20 80  
JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_05  
export JAVA_HOME  
PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH  
export PATH  
CATALINA_HOME=/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29  
  
case $1 in  
start)  
sh $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh  
;;   
stop)     
sh $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh  
;;   
restart)  
sh $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh  
sh $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh  
;;   
esac      
exit 0  
The above script is simple and contains all of the basic elements you will need to get going. 

As you can see, we are simply calling the startup.sh and shutdown.sh scripts located in the Tomcat bin directory (/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/bin). 

You can adjust your script according to your needs and, in subsequent posts, we'll look at additional examples.

CATALINA_HOME is the Tomcat home directory (/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29)

Now, set the permissions for your script to make it executable:

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 init.d]# chmod 755 tomcat  
We now use the chkconfig utility to have Tomcat start at boot time. In my script above, I am using chkconfig: 234 20 80. 2345 are the run levels and 20 and 80 are the stop and start priorities respectively. You can adjust as needed.

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 init.d]# chkconfig --add tomcat  
[root@srv6 init.d]# chkconfig --level 234 tomcat on  
Verify it:

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 init.d]# chkconfig --list tomcat  
tomcat          0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:off   6:off  
Now, let's test our script.

Start Tomcat:
view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 ~]# service tomcat start  
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29  
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29  
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/temp  
Using JRE_HOME:        /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_05  
Using CLASSPATH:       /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/bin/tomcat-juli.jar  
Stop Tomcat:

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 ~]# service tomcat stop  
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29  
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29  
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/temp  
Using JRE_HOME:        /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_05  
Using CLASSPATH:       /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/bin/tomcat-juli.jar  
Restarting Tomcat (Must be started first):

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 ~]# service tomcat restart  
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29  
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29  
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/temp  
Using JRE_HOME:        /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_05  
Using CLASSPATH:       /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/bin/tomcat-juli.jar  
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29  
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29  
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/temp  
Using JRE_HOME:        /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_05  
Using CLASSPATH:       /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/bin/tomcat-juli.jar  
We should review the Catalina.out log located at /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/logs/catalina.out and check for any errors.

view plaincopy to clipboardprint?
[root@srv6 init.d]# more /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/logs/catalina.out
